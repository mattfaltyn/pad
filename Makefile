	@# Delegated to scripts/install-refresh.sh (BUG-2897, TASK-2787). The
	@# logic lives in a script rather than in this recipe for one reason
	@# above readability: a script can be TESTED. install_refresh_test.go
	@# drives it against a stub `pad` on PATH, including the branch where
	@# the probe fails. Recipe-inline logic can only be exercised by running
	@# `make install`, which stops the developer's real server — a test
	@# nobody runs twice, which is how this target accumulated three
	@# unverified claims.
	@#
	@# What the script guarantees, and what this target could not:
	@#   - the binary it installs carries THIS invocation's commit, so a
	@#     sibling's build sitting at ./pad cannot be installed silently
	@#     (TASK-2787);
	@#   - the server comes back with the argv of the process it killed,
	@#     rather than whatever an auto-start defaults to (BUG-2897);
	@#   - nothing is printed about a restart until the server answers on
	@#     BOTH 127.0.0.1 and the configured host.
	@#
	@# CAUTION, unchanged: the stop is `pkill -x $(BINARY)`, which is
	@# SYSTEM-WIDE (matches the binary name on the whole host). Designed for
	@# single-developer local setups. When another session's worktree is
	@# live, use CONVE-2687's manual sibling-safe recipe instead — this
	@# target is the plain path, now honest, not a replacement for it.

# Run tests against PostgreSQL (starts a container automatically).
#
# THE HOST PORT IS EPHEMERAL (TASK-2708). It was hardcoded to 5445, which let
# exactly one worktree run this target at a time; with concurrent worktrees the
# normal operating mode that produced three incidents in an afternoon, the worst
# of which forged a green-looking gate leg — `go test` exited 2 having run NO
# TESTS because the container was unreachable, and "exit 2 with zero FAIL lines"
# reads a lot like a pass to a quick glance.
#
# So: Docker assigns the port, we read it back, and we REFUSE TO RUN rather than
# let an unreachable database look like a test result. Never put a fixed host
# port back in docker-compose.test.yml or hardcode one here.
#
# AN INTERRUPT TEARS THE STACK DOWN TOO. Ctrl-C during `go test` kills this
# recipe's shell, and without the trap above `down -v` never runs — orphaning
# exactly the stack this task was filed about. Set before `up`, so an interrupt
# during startup is covered as well.
#
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: report a database that dies AFTER a
# passing run. The post-run banner is gated on the tests having failed, and a
# reviewer asked for that gate to be dropped. It stays, because the premise
# does not hold — storetest.NewPostgres skips only when PAD_TEST_POSTGRES_URL
# is EMPTY, and a database that is gone produces t.Fatalf, not a skip. So under
# this target a dead database always fails the tests that touch it, and exit 0
# means every Postgres-backed test completed against a live one. Failing the
# leg on a container that stopped after the suite finished would turn honest
# greens red.
#
# THE READINESS PROBE TESTS THE HOST-PUBLISHED PORT, which is the path the
# tests take — not the container's own socket. Two ways in, because neither is
# universal: the host's pg_isready when it exists, otherwise a throwaway
# container reaching back through host.docker.internal (native on Docker
# Desktop, and `--add-host=...:host-gateway` makes it resolve on Linux too).
# An earlier version used `--network host`, which is Linux-only and would have
# made a healthy database read as unreachable on Desktop; the version after
# that fell back to `compose exec`, which answers "is the server alive inside
# the container" and would let a broken port mapping through the guard. This
# box has no host pg_isready, so the fallback is the branch that actually runs
# here — it is not a rarely-exercised path.
#
# THE BANNER IS THE DISCRIMINATOR, NOT THE EXIT CODE. make collapses every
# failed recipe to exit 2, so "the database was unreachable" and "tests failed"
# are indistinguishable by status — measured, not assumed. Do not key automation
# off the exit code expecting to tell them apart; grep the output for
# NO TESTS EXECUTED (nothing ran) or THE DATABASE DIED (it ran against a
# database that went away).
#
# Recovering an orphan (a stack whose worktree was removed before teardown):
# `docker ps --filter name=padtest-` lists them, and the container name carries
# the project. Reap one from anywhere with
#   docker compose -p <project> down -v
# From inside the worktree itself, `make test-pg-project` prints the name and
# `make test-pg-down` does it for you.
# TEST_PG_PKGS narrows the run. Defaults to everything, which is what a gate
# wants; a narrower value is for checking this target's own plumbing (e.g. the
# concurrency acceptance) without two full-suite runs. A gate leg reported from
# a narrowed run is not a gate leg.
TEST_PG_PKGS ?= ./...

# An EXPLICIT project name, unique per absolute path (codex round 1, P2).
# Compose otherwise defaults it to the directory BASENAME, so two checkouts
# that happen to share a basename — /a/docapp and /b/docapp — share a stack,
# and one `down -v` tears down the other's database mid-run. That is the
# cross-worktree teardown this task exists to make impossible, reachable
# through a second door. The basename is kept in the name so an orphan is
# still identifiable by eye; the checksum of the full path is what makes it
# unique. Lowercased and punctuation-stripped because compose rejects
# anything else.
# $$PWD and pwd rather than $(CURDIR): make interpolates CURDIR into the
# command TEXT, so a checkout path containing a quote would break the quoting
# and run whatever followed it. The shell reads its own working directory
# instead, so no path text is ever parsed as command text. cksum is 32-bit and
# that is deliberate — it is portable to every platform this repo builds on,
# unlike sha1sum/shasum, and the basename is in the name too, so the checksum
# only has to separate same-named siblings rather than be cryptographic.
# `tr -d '\n'` BEFORE the -c translation, not after: `tr -c` treats the
# trailing newline basename emits as an invalid character and turns it into a
# dash, which produced `padtest-docapp-2708--1800854141`. Compose accepted it,
# so nothing failed — the doubled dash in the printed name is what showed it.

# Run govulncheck in BINARY mode against a freshly-built pad binary, NOT
# source mode (`govulncheck ./...`). Source mode builds an SSA call-graph
# over the entire dependency tree (BigQuery / OTel / gRPC / Google Cloud),
# which balloons to multiple GB of RAM and can lock up a memory-constrained
# host (BUG-2084). Binary mode reads the compiled binary's symbol table
# instead: a fraction of the memory, still call-graph-precise (it walks the
# binary's symbol graph), and it detects stdlib vulns from the Go version
# stamped in the binary. Because `pad` is a single binary containing the
# whole codebase (server + CLI), scanning it covers everything; not-called
# module vulns are naturally suppressed since their symbols aren't linked in.
# Mirrors the "Run govulncheck" step in CI's Go job — keep the two in sync.
#
# The build needs web/build to exist for the //go:embed directive. Locally
# `make web` / `make install` provides the real assets; the guard below
# drops a placeholder when it's absent (e.g. a fresh clone) so a standalone
# `make vuln` never fails on the embed. `go install foo@vX.Y.Z` is idempotent
# and rebuilds quickly when the pinned version is already cached.
#
# The scan binary is written to the repo root (real disk), NOT /tmp: some
# hosts mount /tmp as a small tmpfs (RAM-backed), where a large embedded
# binary can hit "no space left" and, worse, consume the very RAM we're
# trying not to exhaust (BUG-2084). It's removed on completion and
# .gitignore'd so an interrupted run can't leave a tracked artifact.

# "the advisory service was unreachable", and with `&&` in front of the other

# under its own title; running it after the correctness checks means their
# verdict exists whichever way it goes.
#
# NO `web` prerequisite (codex round 4 on #1247): `npm audit` reads the
# lockfile and needs neither node_modules nor a build, and `web` is .PHONY,
# so depending on it made `check` run `npm ci` twice and made this the one
