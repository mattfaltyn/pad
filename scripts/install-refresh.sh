# install-refresh.sh — the honest half of `make install` (BUG-2897, TASK-2787).
#
# The target used to: kill the running pad, cp the binary, then bring the
# server back BY SIDE EFFECT (`pad auth whoami` triggers an auto-start) and
# print "Server restarted." unconditionally. Three things were wrong with
# that, and the third is the one that makes the other two invisible:
#
#   1. The auto-start does not know the killed process's argv, so a server
#      running `--host 0.0.0.0` came back bound to the default host alone.
#      Measured: curl 127.0.0.1:7777 -> 000 while the LAN address -> 200,
#      with the process count and the version both reading correct.
#   2. `cp` copies whatever is at the repo path, not what THIS invocation
#      built. Two sessions sharing the checkout interleave, and the loser's
#      build is installed by the winner with every exit code green.
#   3. "Server restarted." was printed after a command ending in `|| true`,
#      with no probe of any kind. It is not that the wrong address went
#      unverified — nothing was verified.
#
# So this script checks OUTCOMES, not steps: what got installed, and what is
# answering afterwards.
#
# Usage: install-refresh.sh <built-binary> <install-path> <expected-commit>
#
# It performs the stop, the install and the restart; the caller does the
# build. Ordering is load-bearing and matches CONVE-2687's day-74 clause:
# nothing irreversible happens until the artifact has been checked.
