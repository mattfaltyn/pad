// padItemTool is the v0.2 tool that consolidates the ~20 v0.1 verb
// tools (item_create, item_update, item_block, item_star, ...) into
// one resource × action shape. Largest single ToolDef in the catalog.
//
// Most actions are passThrough — they forward the input verbatim to
// the underlying CLI cmdPath. Two actions are custom:
//
//   - link / unlink — dispatch on link_type to one of several CLI
//     commands (item block / supersedes / implements / split-from /
//     blocked-by, plus their inverses). The custom handler reshapes
//     the uniform schema (`ref`, `target`) into the per-link-type
//     arg names the CLI expects (source_ref/target_ref, new_ref/old_ref,
//     etc.).
//
// Read-modify-write semantics for action=update are handled by the
// HTTPHandlerDispatcher's existing item-update route mapper (TASK-967);
// the catalog just forwards the input.

	//     one that silently unassigns every item it touches. A boolean
	//     carries its destructive meaning in its name and can't be tripped.
	//  2. Only a boolean reaches LOCAL STDIO. BuildCLIArgs emits the CLI's
	//     real flags, so a declared param with no flag behind it is dropped;
	//     these map to `--clear-assigned-user` / `--clear-agent-role`.
	//
	// The empty-string `assigned_user_id: ""` form still works over the

	// automatically and `field` is only needed for fields that
	// don't have a dedicated parameter.
	//
	// Pre-BUG-1431 the description was the bare "Custom field
	// key=value pairs (repeatable)." Agents seeing that often tried
	// `field: {status: ...}` to override status (the wrong placement)

	// expanded description names the dedicated top-level params so
	// agents don't fall back to `field` for them.
	{Name: "field", Type: "array<string>", Description: "Custom field setters for SCHEMA-DECLARED fields without a dedicated top-level param.

Optional for: create, update, list filter, move. implementation_notes, decision_log and convention are REFUSED here on update (BUG-2627) and on move/copy (BUG-2674) — both reach you as code=validation_failed with the server's explanation in the hint (the server's own finer-grained code is not forwarded, so branch on the message if you need to tell the two apart). Each has its own writer: implementation_notes -> action=note, decision_log -> action=decide, convention -> library activation (no update path at all). github_pr is the EXCEPTION on UPDATE ONLY — it is still refused on move/copy, where an override would reintroduce the key the migration just dropped (BUG-2674). The update exemption exists because `pad github link` needs a local git checkout and the `gh` CLI. For remote MCP, use the typed `fields` OBJECT, for example `fields: {\"github_pr\": {\"url\": \"https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/1\", \"number\": 1, \"title\": \"Fix\", \"state\": \"open\"}}`; the string-shaped `field` form double-encodes PR data. Remote unlink is not supported. On CREATE none of the system keys are blocked, because that door is shared with Pad's own writers — but do not hand-write implementation_notes / decision_log there: the value Pad stores cannot be read back, which hides the existing entries AND makes note/decide refuse on that item until it is repaired. On create/update the `fields` OBJECT param is an equivalent alternative."},
	// `fields`: the OBJECT alias for the write path (#1066). Reads
	// return `fields` as a native object, so writing that same shape

Merges into the same path as `field`/the dedicated params; a key given here AND at the top level (or in `field`) with a DIFFERENT value is REFUSED, not silently resolved. Values keep their JSON type: a number stays a number, and an object or array is written as-is to multi_select / json fields (BUG-2850). Two exceptions: `null` is refused (omit the key to leave a field unchanged), and parent/plan must be a string ref. Structured values require the REMOTE transport — the local stdio server shells out to the CLI, whose --field key=value encoding cannot carry them, and refuses with a message naming the transport."},

	// ── List / starred ──
	{Name: "all", Type: "bool", Description: "Include archived/done items in list responses. Optional for: list, starred."},

const padItemToolDescription = `Item operations — the consolidated CRUD + relationships + comments + notes surface.

Actions:
  create        — Create a new item.
                  Required: collection, title.
                  Optional: status, priority, category, content, parent, role, assign, tags,
                  field, fields.
                  Use the dedicated top-level params (status / priority / category / parent
                  / role / assign / tags) for those named fields — the dispatcher rolls
                  them into the item's fields JSON automatically. The 'field' param is
                  the escape hatch for SCHEMA-DECLARED custom fields without a dedicated
                  param; accepts an array of "key=value" strings. The 'fields' OBJECT
                  (the same shape reads return, e.g. {"status":"done","effort":"l"}) is
                  an equivalent write form; the same key with CONFLICTING values in two
                  places is refused rather than resolved.
                  The 'tags' param accepts a JSON array of strings (e.g. ["v1","frontend"])
                  — NOT a comma-separated string.
  update        — Update an item by ref.
                  Required: ref. At least one mutable field.
                  Writing 'content' while a browser tab has the item open sends the
                  markdown to that live document first; the stored copy is updated
                  only by a later collab-snapshot flush — usually from the tab that
                  applied it, though any such write updates the row — and nothing
                  guarantees one happens. The
                  response echoes the content you SENT and carries
                  warnings.content_outcome="applied_pending_flush", which describes
                  this WRITE — the content went to the document, not the row — and is
                  not a live reading of the row, which a concurrent flush may already
                  have updated. A 'get' (or
                  'list' with full=true — a default list carries no content at all)
                  before such a flush lands reads the stored copy and answers with the PREVIOUS
                  content: the lag, not a failed write, so do not re-send on the
                  strength of it. The stored form may also not be byte-identical to what
                  you sent, since the markdown round-trips through the editor, so compare
                  on meaning rather than bytes.
                  Optional: title, status, priority, content, role, assign, parent, comment, tags,
                  field, fields, expected_updated_at.
                  Same placement rules as create. Field updates are applied as a
                  field-level MERGE server-side (only the keys you set change; the
                  rest are preserved), so concurrent single-field updates no longer
                  clobber each other. Pass expected_updated_at (the updated_at you
                  last read) to make the update fail with code=update_conflict if
                  the item changed since — optimistic concurrency for coordinating
                  agents.
  delete        — Archive an item.
                  Required: ref.
  restore       — Un-archive (restore) a soft-deleted item by ref.
                  Required: ref.
  get           — Read an item.
                  Required: ref.
  list          — List items, optionally filtered.
                  Optional: collection, status, priority, parent, unparented, role, assign, all, limit, full.
                  parent and unparented are mutually exclusive. Results are
                  summary-shaped (no content bodies) unless full=true.
  move          — Move an item to a different collection.
                  Required: ref, target_collection.
  link          — Create a relationship between two items.
                  Required: ref, target, link_type.
                  link_type: blocks | blocked-by | supersedes | implements | split-from.
  unlink        — Remove a relationship.
                  Required: ref, target, link_type.
  deps          — Show all dependencies (incoming + outgoing) for an item.
                  Required: ref.
  remind        — Arm a one-shot reminder that fires at a specific instant.
                  Required: ref, remind_at (RFC3339 INSTANT — a bare date is

                  When it fires, the item appears in pad_project next/ready
                  carrying the reminder_id, until you acknowledge it. Use this
                  when you defer work: it is how you ask to be reminded.
  ack-reminder  — Acknowledge a fired reminder so it leaves next/ready.
                  Required: reminder_id (from the fired suggestion, or from
                  the response when you armed it — NOT the item ref, since an
                  item can carry several reminders).
                  Nothing else acknowledges one: completing the item does not,
                  because a reminder may have been armed to fire after the
                  work was done.
  star          — Star an item for quick access.
                  Required: ref.
  unstar        — Remove star.
                  Required: ref.
  starred       — List starred items.
                  Optional: all.
  comment       — Add a comment.
                  Required: ref, message.
                  Optional: reply_to (comment ID for threaded reply).
  list-comments — List comments on an item.
                  Required: ref.
  backlinks     — List inbound [[...]] references to an item ("Mentioned in").
                  Required: ref.
                  Optional: limit (default 50, max 300), offset.
                  Returns same-workspace rows first, then cross-workspace
                  rows (each cross-ws row carries source_workspace_slug).
                  Use this when you need to answer "what other items
                  reference TASK-5?" without scanning the full content
                  corpus.
  history       — Read an item's version history (newest-first, read-only).
                  Required: ref. Optional: limit (default 50, max 300 —
                  the NEWEST N versions), full.
                  Returns a token-light summary per recorded version
                  (id, created_at, created_by, source, change_summary);
                  the resolved content body is omitted. Restoring a
                  version is a web-UI action, not exposed here.
  bulk-update   — Update status/priority across multiple items.
                  Required: refs (array of refs, e.g. ["TASK-5", "TASK-8"]),
                  AND at least one of status / priority.
  note          — Append an implementation note to an item.
                  Required: ref, summary.
                  Optional: details.
  decide        — Record a decision on an item.
                  Required: ref, decision.
                  Optional: rationale.
  export        — Export a playbook or convention as a portable artifact.
                  Required: ref (PLAYB-N / CONVE-N, or slug).
                  Returns the artifact TEXT (YAML frontmatter + Markdown
                  body) as the tool result — ready to hand to import in
                  another workspace. Only playbooks and conventions are
                  exportable; the server rejects any other item type.
                  Read-only / side-effect-free.
  import        — Import a portable artifact as a new DRAFT item.
                  Required: artifact (the full artifact text a prior
                  export produced).
                  Creates a playbook or convention draft (the server
                  gates by the artifact's collection) and returns
                  {ref, slug, warnings}. The item lands as a draft —
                  review and activate it afterward. Mutating but not
                  destructive (creates an item, like create).

ALWAYS prefer issue refs (TASK-5, IDEA-12) over slugs.

When updating status, include comment="why" so the audit trail tells the team
WHY the status changed, not just THAT it did.

//

//     command (the create wasn't a separate edge type) but with
//     operands swapped because unblock takes (source, target) where
//     source is the blocker.
//   - supersedes / implements / split-from: each have their own
//     create + delete commands with type-specific arg names; the
//     positional names are the same in both directions.
//
// Edges that exist in the CLI but aren't exposed here:
//   - decides: standalone action (pad_item.action: decide), not a link
//     because it carries decision text + rationale that don't fit the
//     ref/target shape.
