	// the same replay buffers, counters and presence entries.
	//
	// Set it when two Pad installations share a Redis endpoint. The
	// hazard it removes is real but narrow: delivery is filtered per
	// caller on user id, and user ids are per-installation UUIDs, so
	// cross-feed needs the same id to exist in both — i.e. a CLONED
	// database, such as a staging environment restored from a production
	// dump. For that case it is a genuine cross-tenant leak.
	//
	// Changing it on a running deployment is a cutover, not a tweak, and

	// watch stream through its epoch key, the workspace activity stream
	// through the replay coverage check BUG-2731 added. Expect a burst of
	// client re-fetches as they reconnect — one per RESUME, so a client that
	// reconnects several times re-fetches several times.
	// (Before BUG-2731 the activity stream was the silent one: a client
	// resuming against a fresh replay buffer was treated as caught up and
	// missed the cutover window.) Presence entries are transient and cost
	// nothing either way. It also partitions a rolling upgrade in both
	// directions; see docs/deployment.md.
	RedisNamespace string `toml:"redis_namespace"`

	// EventsPublishEpoch turns on PHASE 2 of the event ID-space migration
	// (BUG-2736): this instance publishes the "<epoch>|<id>|<json>" wire form

	//
	// IT IS A TWO-PHASE FLIP, AND THE ORDER IS NOT OPTIONAL. Every instance
	// ACCEPTS both forms from the release that introduced this field; only
	// emission is gated. An instance running an OLDER binary cannot parse a
	// prefixed payload at all — it fails to unmarshal and drops the event for
	// its own clients — so flipping this before every instance is upgraded
	// loses events for the ones that are not. Phase 1: roll the new binary
	// everywhere with this false. Phase 2: set it true and roll again. Both
	// forms are in flight during that second roll, which is exactly the case
	// accept-both exists for, so it is zero-loss.
	//
	// What phase 2 buys, and why the emission is worth a migration: the epoch
	// identifies WHICH INCARNATION of the shared Redis counter an event came
	// from, so a receiving instance can tell a counter reset from ordinary
	// progress instead of merging two ID spaces into one replay buffer. Phase
	// 2 also moves ID assignment into a single atomic Redis script, so publish
	// order equals ID order globally.
	//
	// Rolling BACK TO PHASE 1 is safe for the same reason: set the EFFECTIVE
	// value false and roll — peers accept the bare form throughout. Two
	// wrinkles, both easy to get wrong: unsetting the environment variable is
	// not the same as setting it false, because this field can also come from
	// config.toml and the file's value stands when the variable is absent; and
	// downgrading PAST phase 1 is a second step in the reverse order, because
	// a pre-phase-1 binary still cannot parse the prefix. See
	// docs/deployment.md for the full procedure in both directions.
	EventsPublishEpoch bool `toml:"events_publish_epoch"`

	// EventsHeartbeat turns on PHASE 2 of the activity-bus heartbeat rollout
	// (BUG-2738): this instance PUBLISHES a bus-internal liveness frame on each
	// workspace channel it is subscribed to, every 30s.
	//
	// WHY A HEARTBEAT AT ALL. A half-open Redis connection — no FIN, no RST,
	// just a route that stopped working — leaves an instance blocked on a read
	// forever while its replay buffer goes on looking complete, so every resume
	// is answered "caught up" from a coverage window that ended when the route
	// did. go-redis cannot see it: its pub/sub health check writes a PING and
	// never reads the reply. Idle detection can, but only if silence is
	// diagnostic — and on a quiet workspace it is not. Publishing our own
	// traffic replaces "is this workspace quiet or is the route dead?" with
	// "did our heartbeat arrive?", which is answerable on every deployment.
	//
	// IT IS A TWO-PHASE FLIP, AND THE ORDER IS NOT OPTIONAL — for the same
	// mechanical reason as EventsPublishEpoch, but with a WORSE failure if you
	// get it wrong. The frame must travel on the workspace's EVENT channel,
	// because that is the connection whose liveness is in question. An instance
	// running an OLDER binary cannot classify it: it falls through to the event
	// decoder, fails, and — since BUG-2739 — treats the failure as a hole in
	// coverage, dropping that workspace's replay buffer AND telling every one
	// of its live subscribers to resync. Every 30 seconds. For every workspace.
	// For as long as the deployment is mixed. Phase 1: roll the new binary
	// everywhere with this false; it recognises and ignores the frame, and does
	// nothing else — no publishing and no detection. Phase 2: set it true and
	// roll again, which turns both on together.
	//
	// PUBLISHING AND DETECTING ARE ONE SWITCH. An instance detects off its own
	// frames — it publishes to the channels it subscribes to and receives them
	// back — so a phase-1 instance does no idle detection at all. Splitting
	// them was tried and is wrong: with neither heartbeat nor events, a healthy
	// QUIET workspace crosses the threshold every 90-120s and is cycled, which
	// is a resync storm on the default configuration.
	//
	// Rolling BACK is safe and immediate: set the EFFECTIVE value false and
	// roll. Peers ignore the frame throughout, and detection stops with it —
	// back to the pre-BUG-2738 behaviour, not to a worse one. The same two wrinkles as
	// EventsPublishEpoch apply — unsetting the environment variable is not the
	// same as setting it false, because config.toml's value stands when the
	// variable is absent; and downgrading PAST phase 1 is a second step in the
	// reverse order, because a pre-phase-1 binary still cannot classify the
	// frame. See docs/deployment.md for the procedure in both directions.
	EventsHeartbeat bool `toml:"events_heartbeat"`

	// WatchHeartbeat turns on PHASE 2 of the WATCH bus's half-open detection
	// (BUG-2769). Separate from EventsHeartbeat and independently flippable:
	// the two buses hold different connections with different fates, and an
	// operator may well roll one before the other.
	//
	// Same mechanics and the same non-optional order as EventsHeartbeat. The
	// frame travels on the watch channel because that is the connection whose
	// liveness is in question, and an instance running an OLDER binary cannot
	// classify it — it reaches the notification decoder, fails, and is treated
	// as a hole in coverage, which drops the replay buffer and tells every one
	// of that instance's live subscribers to resync. Every 30 seconds, for as
	// long as the deployment is mixed. Phase 1: roll the new binary everywhere
	// with this false. Phase 2: set it true and roll again.
	//
