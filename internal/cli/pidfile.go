// pidRecord is what `pad server start` leaves behind so `pad server stop` can
// tell OUR server from whatever else happens to hold that pid.
//
// BUG-2969: before this, stop read a bare pid and signalled it. os.FindProcess
// succeeds for any pid on Unix, nothing asked whether the pid was a pad server,
// and the wait loop then confirmed success by polling the PORT — which is
// unhealthy from the first poll when nothing was ever serving. Measured: a
// `sleep 600` whose pid had been written into the file was SIGTERMed, and stop
// printed "Server stopped." The success check was satisfied by the failure case.
//
// The fields divide by who reads them:
//
//   - PID is what gets signalled.
//   - StartedAt and Exe are for a HUMAN opening the file to work out what stop
//     is talking about. On Windows StartedAt is also the discriminator (see
//     pidfile_windows.go); on Unix the discriminator is an advisory lock, not
//     this timestamp, so do not add logic that trusts it there.
