// Local arm-state file (PLAN-2613 S2, D4; lead ruling "OPTION 2" on the
// TASK-2617 trail). This is the concrete file contract S3's plugin
// monitor builds against, so its rules are load-bearing and stated in
// full here (and mirrored in the S2 evidence package):
//
//   - WHAT IT IS. One file per SESSION recording that the session has
//     armed — declared consent to receive `pad push` notifications. A
//     separate process (S3's monitor) reads it to decide whether the
//     stream it opens should announce armed=true. It is how a short-lived
//     `pad session arm` command hands its intent to the long-lived
//     monitor that actually holds the stream.
//
//   - IT IS LOCAL CLIENT STATE, NOT SERVER STATE (constraint 4). It feeds
//     exactly one thing: the ?armed=true query param the client sends at
//     connect. The SERVER's per-connection armed bit (PLAN-2613 D3, built
//     in S1) remains the SOLE authority for whether a push is delivered.
//     No reader may treat this file as proof that any server-side session
//     is armed — the server never sees it.
//
//   - LIVENESS IS MANDATORY (constraint 2, non-negotiable). A file whose
//     OWNER is dead is treated as DISARMED and may be removed by any
//     reader. "Owner dead" means: the recorded messaging socket has
//     vanished (the Claude Code session it belonged to is gone), or — for
//     the headless fallback with no socket — the recorded pid is no
//     longer running. This is the whole reason the file carries owner
//     identity rather than a bare bit: a crashed session's stale armed
//     file must NEVER arm a future monitor. That would be consent-
//     grandfathering through the filesystem, exactly the silent re-arm
//     PLAN-2613 D6 forbids. When in doubt the check fails CLOSED (treats
//     the owner as dead / the session as disarmed).
//
//   - KEYED PER SESSION (constraint 1). The key is derived from
//     CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET, which both the arming command and the
//     monitor see because they run in the same Claude Code session. With
//     no socket (a headless agent), the key falls back to the working
//     directory — PER-REPO semantics, documented as secondary: the
//     sanctioned headless arming path is .pad.toml auto_arm (D4), not
//     this file, because a short-lived `pad session arm` in a headless
//     shell owns nothing long-lived for liveness to track (its own pid
//     dies with the command). See armStateOwnerAlive.
//
//   - LIFECYCLE (constraint 3). arm writes/overwrites the file
//     (idempotent). disarm REWRITES it as an explicit OFF marker (S3 —
//     see ArmState.Disarmed; removing it would let auto_arm re-arm), and
//     a dead owner gets it reaped. Both verbs are ordinary CLI actions
//     visible in the session transcript (D7).

// ArmState is one session's on-disk arm declaration. Presence of the file
// (with a live owner) identifies the session; Armed/Disarmed say what it
// declared (S3 made this tri-state — see Disarmed), and the other fields
// exist to prove the owner is still alive. Armed is serialized explicitly
// so a human inspecting this security artifact reads intent at a glance.

	// auto_arm=true repo — the disconnect verb must not be a lie there. A
	// file with Disarmed=true is a session-scoped explicit OFF that BEATS

	// armed file: it dies with the session (reaped when the owner is dead),
