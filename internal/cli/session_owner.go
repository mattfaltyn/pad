// Session owner identity (TASK-2767, IDEA-2750 part 2).
//
// Two local files describe "the session this process belongs to": the
// arm-state file (session_arm_state.go) and the session registry
// (session_registry.go). Both must answer the same question — is the
// OWNER of this record still alive, and is it the SAME owner that wrote
// it — and they used to answer it in two places with two different
// vocabularies. SessionOwner is the one identity they share, and
// OwnerLiveness is the one verdict.
//
// WHAT "OWNER" MEANS. The process a short-lived `pad` command was run
// FROM — an agent harness's session process — not the `pad` command
// itself, whose pid is dead before anyone reads the record. The harness
// names it: Claude Code exports CLAUDE_PID; any other harness can export
// PAD_SESSION_PID (the runtime-agnostic override, exactly as PAD_AGENT is
// for the agent name). With neither, the owner is this process — correct
// for a long-lived `pad` process such as a monitor, and the documented
// residual for a bare shell.
//
// WHY LIVENESS IS TRI-STATE. A consent gate and a reaper need opposite
// defaults. A consent gate treats anything uncertain as dead (a stale file
// must never arm a future session — PLAN-2613 constraint 2). A reaper
// treating uncertain as dead would delete every live record on a platform
// where pids cannot be probed (pidAlive reports dead for every pid on
// Windows). So the verdict carries its uncertainty, and each consumer
// applies its own posture: armStateOwnerAlive is `== LivenessAlive`;
// PruneSessions deletes only LivenessDead and leaves LivenessUnknown to
// an explicit age bound.

// Liveness is the verdict on a recorded session owner.
